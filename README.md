# Retro-Arcade-Machine-with-Arduino
Final code
The project consists of recreating a miniature arcade machine with three simple games developed with Arduino:

->STACK: This game consists of stacking floors and getting as high as you can, but be careful to mislead yourself because the speed goes up and the floors are getting smaller.

->SPACE: In this game you must avoid enemies that fall faster each time and get the highest score as you can.

->COCO: Compare your accuracy with friends in a time-limit game and you will see who is the best sniper.
